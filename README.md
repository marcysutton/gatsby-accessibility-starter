## Using this starter

This guide will take you through setting up Novela with Gatsby Starter Novela.

### Step 1: Starter installation

##### With `gatsby-cli`:

```sh
gatsby new novela-site https://github.com/narative/gatsby-starter-novela
```

##### With `git clone`:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:narative/gatsby-starter-novela.git novela-site

cd novela-site

yarn
```

### Step 2: Develop & Build

Once installed or cloned locally and all packages are installed you can begin developing your site.

```sh
# Run localhost
yarn dev

# Build your Gatsby site
yarn build
```

If wanting to use Netlify CMS as the content editor, then you need to be run the proxy in another terminal tab. Then visit
http://localhost:8000/admin to view the editor.
```sh
# Run proxy
yarn proxy
```

### Step 3: Run tests

Run end-to-end accessibility tests with Cypress.

```sh
yarn run test:e2e
```

Tests can also be run in a continuous integration environment without the Cypress UI:

```sh
yarn run test:e2e:ci
```
